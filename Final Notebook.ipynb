    "For my Project and to demonstrate the skills that I have developed in Code Louisville, I selected the Powerball.  I picked this topic because I was curious if there was any way to game the system and try to find some kind of statistical advantage that would increase the odds of winning.  In my time exploring that information I got to thinking about a few other things:  Finding and using the most occuring numbers is all good, but could we set ourselves up for the BEST case to win?  So I have analyzed the best State to play, the best Jackpot amount to play even the best day to play!  Then I got to thinking about the Why?  Why do people play Powerball? The odds of winning are so low it's actually hard to really understand how small it is.  In looking into this I think I discovered the underlying reason for who plays the Powerball and why.  Let's go!\n",
    "\n",
    "(As a side note, the info here is an amalgamation of hours and hours of analysis that has been written in several Jupyter Notebooks in my Github for this project.  These are just the highlights to prove my point.  If for some reason you want to see all my work, it's all there)"

    "The Powerball is a lottery game that most states participate in, where 5 numbers in a range of 1-69 are drawn with a final 'Powerball' being drawn with a numeric range of 1-26.  The objective is for the individual to pick all the numbers that are drawn at random and then you are given so much money.  Easy, right?  Well the odds of winning the powerball is 1 in 292.2 million.  So, no.  Yet still, the Powerball has grown in popularity year over year and as the population grows so does the participation in the Powerball.  "

    "In my exploration of the data I had gathered I discovered that there was a issue with the min max of some of my data.  Come to find out, there was a rule change of the range of the PowerBall.  Looking into this weirdness, apparently in 2015 Powerball changed their Rules on how the game is played as they expanded states to increase the odds of winning, they changed the range of the actual PowerBall from 1-39 to 1-26, to get more people to play.  So I excluded the data up to the switch date for when trying to calculate the best way to win, so that it will all be uniformed with the current ruleset.  I kept the states data as they are."

    "For my process in how to accomplish these tasks I utilized mostly Python in the IDE Jupyter Notebook.  Most of my Web Scrapers I did in PyCharm Community Edition, except for one which I used Jupyter.  I also performed several SQL merges and cleanings in the SQLite IDE DB Browser.  For my libraries I used Pandas, matplotlib, sqlite3, re, numpy, requests, beautifulsoup and seaborn. I also used Tableau for a few visualizations.  I found a few great resources for years of Powerball drawing number data, I also found a lot of statistics on websites that I used web scrapers that I designed to extract that info for formatting to dataframes in Pandas for analysis.  My approach was mostly to try to understand the problems at hand I wanted to address, collect the data, clean all the data up, explore and analyze, interpret the data, visualize it and find the story within it.  \n"

The exposure of seeing people who have such nice things could easily be a factor that would inspire someone to want to hit it big with the lottery, odds be damned! I also think because we are in the Information Age, social media could also play a role in inciting the lust for quick fortune and instant gratification.  The shrinking of the Middle Class could also be a contributing factor to the growth for similar reasons.  All of these COULD be factors, but with the information I have, it's indeterminate.  Just some idea that I wanted to explore with what was available."

    "In conclusion: Hitting the Powerball is hard.  Even doing everything we can, the odds of winning aren't great.  Yet that doesn't stop people from playing.  Why?  Shouldn't we know when we can't win?  No.  We can't.  Because we are human.  For better or worse, that nature is part of the reason we as a species are still here.  \"WE\" are the heroes of our story.  \"WE\" can!  It's our blessing and our curse; to keep trying even if trying is nearly impossible.  The Powerball is a lot of things.  It's a lot of money.  But what it represents is even more: Hope.  It's just a surrogate of a dream, that \"WE\" can be lucky enough.  I say: \"Why not?\".  Statistically I think I have proven why not, but will that stop The Dream?  I think not.  \n",

    "Through this journey I also learned that maybe the Powerball is not only a game of chance, but a potential barometer for the state of the good ol' USA.  It might show us that exposure to others' fantastic lives, could drive us to rely on chance to even the odds.  Maybe, through the Powerball, we can watch year over year as the rich get richer and the rest of us do everything that we can to try to improve our situations.  This project can't say.  But I hope it gives you something to think about. I hope it was a little entertaining. But above all else: I hope it's given you the edge to win.  Because after all, \"Someones gotta win.  Might as well be you\".  Thank you for reading!"
