    "This project aimed to answer a simple question: What's the best way to Win the Powerball?  Simple!  In it, I explore various approaches to try to game the system by analyzing statistical occurrences from the numbers themselves, as well as a little more abstract potential 'Luck' from data of winners.  After all, we are trying to win; why not try everything that COULD improve our odds, even things that aren't the statistics of the numbers themselves.  I explore the best numbers to play, best State to play in, best Jackpot to go for, best month to play, even the best draw date!  \n",
    "\n",
    "As I explored the data and started to see the story, the data painted a different picture: Maybe the Powerball is being played more and more out of desperation?  I briefly touch on what the data COULD potentially be telling us about why more people are playing than ever before; but that's not this project's main purpose.  The main purpose is to WIN!\n"
